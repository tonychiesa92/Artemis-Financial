## About
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. As an important step in Artemis Financial’s desire to modernize its operations and as a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface and is seeking expertise in taking steps to protect their client data and financial information.

## Motivation & Requirements
Artemis Financial is seeking to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. When their web application is used to transfer data, they will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. I have been asked to take their current software application and add secure communication mechanisms to meet their software security requirements. The final deliverable will be a production quality integrated application that includes secure coding protocols.

## Usage
This repo includes:

The code base for the project.

The Vulnerability Assessment Report inclueds Interpreting Client Needs, Areas of Security, Manual Review, Static Testing, and a Mitigation Plan.

The Practices for Secure Software Report includes the Algorithm Cipher, Certificate Generation, Deploy Cipher, Secure Communications, Secondary Testing, and Functional Testing.

## Applying Skills Learned To Future Development Projects
- What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

- What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

- How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

- How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
